#COMPETITIVE PROGRAMING CODE

Description:

  The programming problems are solved using python programming language which is user friendly to all the people to learn and explore.
  
  The programming code is been done using lots of comment lines to ake user understand easilyThis programming code is for those people 
  who find difficulty in solving the programming problem.
  
  The .py file contains the code for the following programming problems:
  
      * Arrange words in a string in the order of their incresing length.
      
      * Removing duplicate elements from the sorted array.
      
      * print the data based on the entered day and year(considering leap years also).
      
      * The bottle shipping problem(input the total number of bottles to be shipped by the company. The function prints the break-up of the number of cartons used in descending order of capacity).
      
      * Design your own stack and perform the push(), pop() and peek() functions. You are allowed to use only arrays or linked lists.
  
  The programming code targets the audience who are at the begginer level of the python programming language and this code could help them solve the programming questions.

  The key feature is that the programming code is user friendly since the language used in the entire code is python.
